# Semantic-Search-and-Q-A-System-Using-Vertex-AI

This repository contains the code for building a semantic search and Q&A system using Google Cloud Vertex AI and BigQuery. The system retrieves Stack Overflow questions and answers, embeds the questions using a pre-trained text embedding model, and performs a semantic search to find the most relevant answers to user queries.
